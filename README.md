## FAQ

#### How did you come up with an idea for storing photos and videos?

I got this idea from Google Drive API. The app will ask users to sign in with their own Google Drive. Then, it uploads media, fetches public links, and store them into database.

#### How much did you spend on this project?

$0. I used all the free services to build this project.

#### Is it secure to use?

I did not set up a backend server for this app as I did not want to spend a dime on CPU usage. I tried my best to keep it secure. However, you may contribute or sponsor for better performance and web security.

#### Where to report crashes and bugs?
Feel free to email me via codejapoe@gmail.com.
